# Privacy Guide (Draft)

I created this guide to keep track of my knowledge around personal privacy/security. Knowledge and recommendations are included. I consider ease of use as a factor (no Tor).

## Privacy vs Security
Security is tailored towards protecting yourself from unauthorized access, whether that be your devices or online accounts. Privacy is tailored towards protecting yourself from being identified, tracked, targeted, and/or more easily manipulated by technology companies and the government.

## The Cardinal Sin
Any service/device (only exception is Google's "Results About You" and authenticator apps) offered or owned by Google or Microsoft. They extract way too much information.

# Security
## Password Manager
A password manager allows you to easily create unique and effective passwords without recalling them manually (from memory). This allows for separation of each of your online accounts by creating a unique password for each. Just make sure your password to access your password manager is really good & memorable and you keep your recovery codes secure.

## 2FA
Two Factor Authentication (2FA) is an additional safeguard to access online accounts that will either send you an SMS to your phone with a code to verify its really you (less preferred) or ask for an authentication code that you can provide by accessing an authenticator app (more preferred).

### Authenticator Apps
Remember to back up your codes so if you lose your phone you're good.
 - google authenticator / microsoft authenticator

## Recovery Codes

## Data Breach Notifications
If you setup 2FA for your accounts, having your password leaked in a data breach shouldn't be as troublesome, but you definitely want to know if you account information has been leaked so you can change your password ASAP.
